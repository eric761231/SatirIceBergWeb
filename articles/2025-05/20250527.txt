這真是令人困惑－特別是對真陷於抗拒狀態的人而言－
都覺在不應該為自己在抵抗。
他完全不自覺…所以他當自己是不知。
不想，使無法停止。
他創造他自己的症狀但不承認它，而最後
他始終為著自己的受苦辯護。
除非他看到自己的抗拒，否則進展是不會有促進的，且他會
繼續抗拒且因此破壞任何成長的努力。

事事本無礙

The perplexing thing--especially to the individual caught in this resistance--is that he...honestly doesn't think he's resisting. He is totally unaware of it....So he hurts himself without knowing it. And because he does not know it, he cannot stop. He produces his own symptoms but won't admit it, and thus he ends up defending his suffering. Until he sees his own resistance...no progress whatsoever is gained, for he will continue to resist and therefore sabotage any effort at growth.
