星期四    第十八週
Thursday   Week Eighteen

一些印度教人在暗室裡展示一隻象，並且聚集很多人過來參觀；可是，由於地方實在太暗了，無法清楚地看到那隻象。因此，他們全用手去觸摸感覺，以得知牠的模樣。有人摸到象鼻，他聲稱這動物像條水管；一個人摸到耳朵，說牠一定是個大扇子；一個人摸到象腿，認為大象就跟柱子一樣；另一個人摸到牠的背，他說大象就像是巨大的寶座。每個人根據他所摸到的部分，給了這動物不同的描述⋯⋯

我們藉以視物的眼睛就像手掌心，
而掌心並無法捕捉事物的完整。
海洋是海洋，泡沫是泡沫。
忽略那泡沫吧，用你的眼睛去看海洋。
泡沫的波浪日以繼夜地從海洋中產生，
這時你看到泡沫的漣漪而不見巨大的海洋
我們就像船，被海浪搖向此處，盪向彼處
雖然在光明的海洋上，卻是盲目的。
啊，你在身體的船中沉睡，
你看到水，看到那水之水。

——Rumi

Some Hindus were exhibiting an elephant in a dark room, and many people collected to see it. But as the place was too dark to permit them to see the elephant, they all felt it with their hands, to gain an idea of what it was like. One felt the trunk, and declared that the beast resembled a water pipe; another felt its ear, and said it must be a large fan; another its leg, and thought it must be a pillar; another felt its back, and declared the elephant must be like a great throne. According to the part which each felt, he gave a different description of the animal....

The eye of outward sense is as the palm of a hand,
The whole of the object is not grasped in the palm.
The sea itself is one thing, the foam another;
Neglect the foam, and regard the sea with your eyes.
Waves of foam rise from the sea night and day,
You look at the foam ripples and not the mighty sea.
We, like boats, are tossed hither and thither,
We are blind though we are on the bright ocean.
Ah! you who are asleep in the boat of the body,
You see the water. Behold the Water of Waters!

——Rumi
