星期五   第十七週
Friday   Week Seventeen

Nasrudin 正從朝聖地返家，在距離家園還有好幾天路程的地方，他的老驢終於是死了。所以他找專門放款的人希望能借點錢再買一頭驢子。但那放款的人並不情願將錢借給從來沒見過的人。
“我不認識你，你可以確認你是誰嗎？” 放款的人問。
隨之，Nasrudin 從口袋拿出一面鏡子看看自己，他說：“是的，我可以。”

蘇菲教派故事

Nasrudin was returning from a pilgrimage, still many days journey from home, when his old donkey finally died. So he went looking for a money-lender to borrow enough to buy another donkey. But the money-lender was reluctant to lend money to a man he had never seen before.
"I don't know you. Can you identify yourself?" the money-lender asked.
Nasrudin pulled a mirror out of his pocket. He held it up and looked at himself.
"Yes," he said.
