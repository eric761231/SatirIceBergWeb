Wednesday   Week Eighteen

不出戶，知天下；不闖牖，見天道。其出彌遠。其知彌少。
是以聖人不行而知，不見而明，不為而成。

——老子，道德經47章

Without going outside, you may know the whole world.
Without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven.
The farther you go, the less you know.
Thus the wise person knows without traveling.
He sees without looking.
He works without doing.


——Lao Tzu
    Tao Te Ching, Chapter 47
