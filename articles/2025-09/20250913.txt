身體的每一微粒，思維的每一個過程都處於持續變遷的狀態。
沒有事物可以存留多過一刻，沒有核心可以緊附，沒有任何東西能夠稱為「我」或「我的」。
這個「我」事實上只是不斷改變的過程之組合罷了。
任何要抓住某些東西的努力，說：「這是我，這是我的」，
將注定讓一個人不快樂，因為這被依附的東西遲早會消失，
或者這個「我」會消失。依附於非永久、短暫的、虛幻的，
以及超越個人控制的事物是讓人痛苦的……

Every particle of the body, every process of the mind is in a state of constant flux. 
There is nothing that remains beyond a single moment, no hard core to which one can cling, nothing that one can call "I" or "mine." This "I" is really just a combination of processes that are always changing....
Any effort to hold on to something, saying "This is I, this is me, this is mine" is bound to make one unhappy, because sooner or later this something to which one clings passes away, or else this "I" passes away. 
Attachment to what is impermanent, transitory, illusory, and beyond one's control is suffering....
——S. N. Goenka
