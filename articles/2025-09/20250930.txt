當沒有什麼是想要的，就不會有什麼對抗什麼。不去抓住任何東西，
就沒有抓的人和被抓住的物……………不執著於視、聽、嗅、味、觸覺。在
每一神奇的片刻裡，僅無礙地、自發地、自由地體驗著事物本質。這
是自然偉大的圓滿。

——Lama Surya Dass

When there is nothing wanting, there is nothing
working against anything. There is no grasping at
anything; there is no grasper and nothing being
grasped....there is no clinging to sights or sounds or
smells or tastes or touches. There is just the unimpeded,
spontaneous, free, experiencing of things just as they
are, moment after miraculous moment. This is the
natural great perfection.

——Lama Surya Dass
