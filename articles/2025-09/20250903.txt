Wednesday   Week Nineteen

追求靈性的那份渴望，事實上只不過是自我的好於追求，然而這份對靈性的追求其本身就是個障礙。因此「完美的實踐」不是去尋求靈悟，而是去探討追求背後的動力。你的追求明顯地是為了逃避當下，然而答案僅在當下裡；不斷追求就是不斷錯過。你一直以來本是已悟的靈，所以追求靈性只是在否定靈性。追求靈性就像追求你的腳或肺一樣。

The very desire to seek spiritual enlightenment is in fact nothing but the grasping tendency of the ego itself, and thus the very search for enlightenment prevents it. The "perfect practice" is therefore not to search for enlightenment but to inquire into the motive for seeking itself. You obviously seek in order to avoid the present, and yet the present alone holds the answer: to seek forever is to miss the point forever. You always already are enlightened Spirit, and therefore to seek Spirit is simply to deny Spirit. You can no more attain Spirit than you can attain your feet or acquire your lungs.
