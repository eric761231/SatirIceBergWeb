有一次,一位武士來到禪師 Hakuin 的面前。
「聽說您是一位偉大的禪師」他說。
「所以我想請您告訴我關於天堂與地獄的真相,它們真的存在嗎?」
Hakuin 毫不猶豫地回答:
「什麼?像你這樣一個醜陋又無能的人也能成為武士,太神奇了!」
驕傲的武士立刻勃然大怒並且拔出他的劍大吼說:「我要殺了你!」
Hakuin 無懼的說:「這就是地獄。」
武士停了下來開始思考,臉上緊皺的眉頭漸漸消去,
套上他的劍,雙手合十並向 Hakuin 鞠躬。
「這就是天堂。」Hakuin 平靜的說。

Once a samurai came before Zen Master Hakuin.
"You're supposed to be a great Zen master," he said.
"So I want you to tell me the truth about heaven and hell. Do they"
"really exist?"
Without a moment's hesitation Hakuin responded. "What, even such"
"an ugly and untalented man as you can become a samurai? Amazing!"
Immediately the proud samurai swelled with anger and drew his sword.
"I'll kill you!" he roared.
Fearlessly Hakuin said, "This is hell."
The samurai paused and grew thoughtful. His face softened from its"
"angry scowl. Sheathing his sword, he put his hands together palm to"
"palm and bowed before Hakuin."
"And this," said Hakuin, just as calmly, "is heaven."
