Week Twenty One

思維:
既然沒有所謂思維這回事,
那它該用什麼樣的啟發來被啟發?
思維:
沒有盡頭,沒有開始,
縱然它出生,縱然它死去,
乃空之精粹。
寫東西流傳下去,
不過是場夢罷了。
當醒著時我們曉得,
並沒有人讀它。

——Ikkyu 日本禪宗大師一修 (1394-1481)

The mind:
Since there is really
No such thing as mind
With what enlightenment
Shall it be enlightened?
The mind:
Without end, without beginning,
Though it is born, though it dies,
The essence of emptiness.
To write something and leave it behind us,
It is but a dream.
When we awake we know
There is not even anyone to read it.

——Ikkyu, (1394-1481) Japanese Zen Master.
