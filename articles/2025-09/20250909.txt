星期二    第二十週      
Tuesday   Week Twenty

就像空曠的天空沒有疆界，
它就在這個地方，深奧而清澈。
當你尋求解它，你無法看見它，
你無法掌握它，但你也不會失去它。
當你不能得到它時，就得到了它。
當你沈默，它說話。
當你說話，它沈默。
大門敞開著發放佈施，
而且沒有群眾阻擋在路上。
——Cheng-tao Ke

Like the empty sky it has no boundaries, 
Yet it is right in this place, 
ever profound and clear. 
When you seek to know it, you cannot see it. 
You cannot take hold of it, 
But you cannot lose it. 
In not being able to get it, you get it. 
When you are silent, it speaks. 
When you speak, it is silent. 
The great gate is wide open to bestow alms, 
And no crowd is blocking the way.
——Cheng-tao Ke
