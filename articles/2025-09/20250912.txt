Friday   Week Twenty

我們活在事物的幻象與表面中。
真相是存在的，而你就是真相。
看到了，你便知道你就是萬物。
身為萬物，你無一物。
就是如此。
——Kalu Rinpoche
 卡盧仁波切

We live in the illusion and appearance of things.
There is a Reality. 
You are that Reality. 
Seeing this, you know that you are everything. 
And being everything, you are nothing. 
That is all.
——Kalu Rinpoche
