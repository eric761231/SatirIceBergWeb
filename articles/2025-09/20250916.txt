星期二                                                        第二十一週
Tuesday                                                 Week Twenty One

否認事物的實相
就會錯過它們的實相
斷言事物的空虛
就會錯過它們的實相
想得越多，講得越多
就越是遠離真理，誤人歧路
停止言談和思考，就能夠無所不知
直接與實相融和
當疑惑升起，只要說「非二」
在「非二」中，
沒有分離，
沒有排除。

——Seng Tsan, Third Patriarch of Zen
  中國禪宗三祖僧璨大師

To deny the reality of things
is to miss their reality;
to assert the emptiness of things
is to miss their reality.
The more you talk and think about it,
the further astray you wander from the truth.
Stop talking and thinking
and there is nothing you cannot know.
To live in direct union with reality,
when doubts arise, simply say "Not-two."
In this "Not-two,"
nothing is separate,
nothing is excluded.

——Seng Tsan, Third Patriarch of Zen
