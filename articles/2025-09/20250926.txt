如果你是個詩人，你會在這紙張裡面清楚地看到一朵漂浮的雲。沒有雲，就沒有雨；
沒有雨，樹木就不會成長；沒有樹，我們就不能造紙。雲的存在對於紙的存在是必要的。
如果雲不在這，紙也不會在這。

如果我們更深入地看這張紙，我們會在其中看到陽光；如果沒有陽光，森林就不能成長，
事實上，是沒有任何東西能夠成長。假使我們繼續看下去，我們可以看到樵夫將樹砍下
並且運送到工廠製造成紙，我們也會看到小麥，因為知道樵夫若是沒有每日的麵包無法存活，
所以製成麵包的小麥也在紙張之中。同樣的，樵夫的父母也在其中。我們這樣去看，
就會見到若沒有上述種種事物，這紙張將無法存在。

更深入來看，我們會看到自己也在其中。這並不難理解，因為當我們看著這張紙，
它就成為我們感知的一部份，你的思維和我的都在此，所以我們可以說一切事物
都在這張紙之中。

——Thich Nhat Hanh

If you are a poet, you will clearly see that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. 
Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, 
we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, 
the sheet of paper cannot be here either.

If we look into this sheet of paper even more deeply, we can see the sunshine in it. 
If sunshine is not there the forest cannot grow. In fact, nothing can grow....And if we continue 
to look, we can see the logger who cut the tree and brought it to the mill to be transformed 
into paper. And we can see the wheat. We know that the logger cannot exist without his daily 
bread, and therefore the wheat that became his bread is also in this sheet of paper. 
And the logger's father and mother are in it, too. When we look in this way, we see that 
without all of these things, this sheet of paper cannot exist.

Looking even more deeply, we can see that we are in it, too. This is not difficult to see, 
because when we look at a sheet of paper, the paper is part of our perception. Your mind is 
in here and mine is also. So we can say that everything is in here with this sheet of paper.

——Thich Nhat Hanh
