Week Twenty One

人們在醒著的時候跟睡著的時候一樣,
總是對周遭的事物健忘與大意,
就像傻子-如聾子一般聽而不聞,
對他們而言,他們在的時候他們都不在
醒著的人擁有相同的世界,
而睡著的每個人擁有自己私人的世界。
你不可能在同樣的溪流中涉足兩次,
所有的事物都會流逝不會守候。

——西元前六世紀希臘哲學家
  Heraclitus

Men are as forgetful and heedless in their waking moments
Of what is going on around them as they are during their sleep.
Fools — although they hear, they are like the deaf.
To them the saying applies that
Whenever they are present they are absent.
The waking have one world in common;
Sleepers each have a private world of his own.

——Heraclitus, Greek Philosopher.
  6th Century BC
