獲得覺悟猶如映照在水中的月亮,月亮不會濕,水也不會受到干擾。
雖然月的亮光是那樣廣大,但它仍可映照在即使只有一吋寬的小水塘,
草上的一滴露珠就能夠映射整個月亮和天空。
覺悟不會干擾人,就像月光不會干擾水。
人不會阻礙覺悟,就像露珠不會阻礙天上的月亮。
水滴的深度就是月亮的高度。
至於映照的時間有多長,你應該去檢視水的廣闊或微小,也去辨别月
亮的明亮或晦暗。

  道元禪師

Gaining enlightenment is like the moon reflecting in the water.
The moon does not get wet, nor is the water disturbed.
Although its light is extensive and great, the moon is reflected
even in a puddle an inch across.
The whole moon and the whole sky are reflected in dewdrop
in the grass, in one drop of water.
Enlightenment does not disturb the person, just as the moon
does not disturb the water.
A person does not hinder enlightenment, just as a dewdrop
does not hinder the moon in the sky.
The depth of the drop is the height of the moon.
As for the duration of the reflection, you should examine the
water's vastness or smallness,
And you should discern the brightness or dimness of the
heavenly moon.

——Dogen
