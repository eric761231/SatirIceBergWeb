星期三    第二十週      
Wednesday   Week Twenty

視之不見，名曰夷；
聽之不聞，名曰希；
搏之不得，名曰微。
此三者不可致詰，故混而為一。
其上不皦，其下不昧。
繩繩不可名，復歸於無物。
是謂無狀之狀，無物之象，是謂惚恍。
迎之不見其首，隨之不見其後。
執古之道，以御今之有。
能知古始，是謂道紀。
——— Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching Chapter 14
    老子，道德經14章

English Translation：
Look, it cannot be seen — it is beyond form.
Listen, it cannot be heard — it is beyond sound.
Grasp, it cannot be held — it is intangible.
These three are indefinable;
Therefore they are joined in one.

From above it is not bright;
From below it is not dark;
An unbroken thread beyond description.
It returns to nothingness.
The form of the formless,
The image of the imageless,
It is called indefinable and beyond imagination.

Stand before it and there is no beginning.
Follow it and there is no end.
Stay with the ancient Tao,
Move with the present.

Knowing the ancient beginning is the essence of Tao.
— Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching Chapter 14
