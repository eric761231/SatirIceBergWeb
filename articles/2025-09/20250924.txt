我們尋找快樂,正是這一點讓我們看不見快樂:就像一道鮮明的彩虹,
卻無法捕捉;或像一隻小狗,永遠追不到自己的尾巴。雖
然平和與快樂不像一個實物或實景般存在,但它們是隨時存在的,而
且時時刻刻陪伴著你。

——Achan Chah
  阿姜查

Only our own searching from happiness prevents us
from seeing it. It is like a vivid rainbow which you
pursue without ever catching it, or a dog chasing
its own tail. Although peace and happiness do not
exist as an actual thing or place, they are always
available, and accompany you every instant.

——Achan Chah
