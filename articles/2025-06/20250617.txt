籃球是一個複雜的舞蹈，必須能夠很快地從一個目標移動到另一個目標。要有傑出的表現，就必須有清晰的思維，並且隨時完全專注在場上每一個人的動向——敏銳地知曉當下所發生的一切，每一個當下。其祕密不在於思考——這並不代表要變笨，而是讓腦中的紛擾雜念安靜下來，好讓你的身體不受心智干擾，依憑著直覺去做它所該做。

——Phil Jackson（洛杉磯湖人隊教練）

Basketball is a complex dance that requires shifting from one objective to another at lightening speed. To excel, you need to act with a clear mind and be totally focused on what everyone on the floor is doing...to become more acutely aware of what's happening right now, this very moment.

The secret is not thinking. That doesn't mean being stupid; it means quieting the endless jabbering of thoughts so that your body can do instinctively what it's been trained to do without the mind getting in the way.

——Phil Jackson
(Coach of the Los Angeles Lakers)
