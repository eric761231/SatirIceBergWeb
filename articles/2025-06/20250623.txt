為學日益,為道日損。損之又損,以至於無為。
無為而無不為。
取天下常以無事,及其有事,不足以取天下。

——老子,道德經48章

In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.
In the pursuit of the Tao, every day something is dropped.
Less and less is done
Until non-action is achieved.
When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.
The world is ruled by letting things take their course.
It cannot be ruled by interfering.
——Lao Tzu,
  Tao Te Ching, Chapter 48
