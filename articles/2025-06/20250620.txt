在流動的狀態中，
依照內在邏輯，行動接著行動，
似乎不需要行動者有意識的介入。
行動者體驗著整體的流動，從一個時刻到下一個時刻。
他完全自主，
自己與環境之間幾無區分，
無所謂刺激與反應，
不分過去、現在和未來。

——Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

In the flow state, action follows upon action according to an internal logic that seems to need no conscious intervention by the actor. He experiences it as a unified flowing from one moment to the next, in which he is in control of his actions, and in which there is little distinction between self and environment, between stimulus and response, or between past, present, and future.

——Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
