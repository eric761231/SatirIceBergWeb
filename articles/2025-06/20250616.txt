星期一                                                        第八週
Monday                                                    Week Eight

當一個射手不為什麼而射擊的時候
他擁有完全的技巧
當他為一個銅鈕而射擊時
會感到緊張
當他為一面金牌而射擊時
則變得失常而且看到兩個標靶
這時候的他像然變成兩個人

其實，射手的技巧從未改變
但那獎賞使他分心了
心思中暗藏多猶射擊
而求勝的心耗盡了他的力量

——莊子

When an archer is shooting for nothing
He has all his skill.
If he shoots for a brass buckle
He is already nervous.
If he shoots for a prize of gold
He goes blind or sees two targets—
He is beside himself.

The archer's skill has not changed.

But the prize divides him.
He thinks more of winning than of shooting—
And the need to win
Drains him of his power.

——Chuang Tzu
