一位男子聽說那斯魯丁很有智慧,便專程去拜訪他。
他觀察到那斯魯丁先是吹氣暖手,後來又吹氣涼湯。
男子因此認為那斯魯丁是個騙子,因為他用同樣的氣息做相反的事情,
並最終認定那斯魯丁不是一位導師。

——Idries Shah

A man heard that Nasrudin was very wise, so he went to visit him.
He observed that Nasrudin first blew on his hands to warm them,
and later blew on his soup to cool it.
The man therefore thought that Nasrudin was a fraud,
because he used the same breath to do opposite things,
and finally concluded that Nasrudin was not a teacher.
