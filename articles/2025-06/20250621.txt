星期六                                                        第八週
Saturday                                                  Week Eight

周，一位素描家
可以徒手畫出許多完美的圓形而不需要圓規的幫助
他的手指隨興地自然劃動
心靈完全的自由
對於正在做的事毫無所顧念

毋需思考
心靈全然單純
不見阻礙
所以，當鞋子完全合腳的時候
你會忘記腳的存在
當腰帶完全合身的時候
你會忘卻肚腹的存在

當心對了
支持與反對便被遺忘了

無駕力，無衝動
無需求，無慾望
便可掌握自己
自由自在不受拘束

輕鬆是對的
一開始就對了，你就輕鬆了
繼續輕鬆，就對了
若要輕鬆，對的做法就是要忘卻的做法且忘卻這一路的輕鬆

——莊子

Chui the draftsman
Could draw more perfect circles freehand
Than with a compass.

His fingers brought forth
Spontaneous forms from nowhere.
His mind was meanwhile free
And without concern for what he was doing.

No thought was needed,
And knew no obstacle.

So, when the shoe fits
The foot is forgotten,
When the belt fits
The belly is forgotten,

When the heart is right
"For" and "against" are forgotten.

No drives, no compulsions,
No needs, no attractions.
Then your affairs are under your control.
You are a free man.

Easy is right. Begin right
And you are easy.
Continue easy and you are right.
The right way to be easy

Is to forget the right way
And forget that the going is easy.

——Chuang Tzu
