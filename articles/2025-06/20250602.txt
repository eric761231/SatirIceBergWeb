Monday   Week Six

那斯路丁去肉舖買一些肉作晚餐。他看了所有肉販擺出來各式不同的肉，但是無法決定要買什麼。
於是那斯路丁問肉販：「我無法決定晚餐要買什麼，哪一塊肉是最好的？」
那個肉販答道：「我這裡所有的肉都是最好的！」
當肉販道出那一句話時，在那一刻，那斯路丁頓悟了。

  蘇菲教義記實

Nasrudin went into a butcher's shop to buy some meat for dinner.
He looked around at all the different cuts of meat the butcher had on display.
But he couldn't make up his mind what to buy.
So Nasrudin said to the butcher,
"I can't decide what to buy for dinner. Which cut of meat is the best?"
The butcher replied,
"All of my cuts of meat are the best."
And when the butcher spoke those words, in that moment Nasrudin became enlightened.
