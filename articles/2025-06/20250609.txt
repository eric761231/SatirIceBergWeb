上士聞道，勤而行之；
中士聞道，若存若亡；
下士聞道，大笑之。
不笑不足以為道。
故建言有之：
明道若昧，進道若退，夷道若纇；
上德若谷；
大白若辱；
廣德若不足；
建德若偷；
質真若渝；
大方無隅，大器晚成，大音希聲，大象無形；
道隱無名。夫唯道，善貸且成。

——老子道德經第四十一章

The wise student hears of the Tao and practices it diligently.
The average student hears of the Tao and gives it thought now and then.
The foolish student hears of the Tao and laughs aloud.
If there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is.

So it is said:
The bright path seems dim;
Going forward seems like retreat;
The easy way seems hard;
The greatest virtue seems empty;
Great purity seems sullied;
A wealth of virtue seems inadequate;
The strength of virtue seems weak;
Real virtue seems unreal;
The perfect square has no corners;
Great talents ripen late;
The highest notes are hard to hear;
The greatest form has no shape;
The Tao is hidden and without name.
The Tao alone nourishes and brings everything to fulfillment.

——Lao Tzu
Tao Te Ching, Chapter 41
