若干年後,我們都將死亡。單純地將死亡視為生命的終點,那是錯誤的理解;
但如果認為我們不會死,亦是錯誤的。我們死,我們不死。有些人認為精神
靈魂不死,只有肉體會腐朽,這亦非全然正確,因為不論是肉體或是心靈都
有終了的一天,但與此同時,它們永久存在也是真實的。即我們說精神與肉
體,它們其實是一體兩面的。

——Shunryu Suzuki Roshi
  鈴木俊隆

After some years we will die. If we just think that it is the end of our
life, this will be the wrong understanding. But, on the other hand, if
we think that we do not die, this is also wrong. We die, and we do
not die....Some people may say that our mind or soul exists forever,
and it is only our physical body which dies. But this is not exactly right,
because both mind and body have their end. But at the same time it is
also true that they exist eternally. And even though we say mind and
body, they are actually two sides of one coin.

——Shunryu Suzuki Roshi
