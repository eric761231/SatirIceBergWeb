星期五                                                     第十二週
Friday                                                    Week Twelve

如果你想要知道永恆,
它並不比當下更多。
如果你無法在此刻就抓住它,
你將不會得到它。
無論你在千百年裏重生多少次。

——Zen Master Seppo
  禪學大師

If you want to know what eternity means,
it is no further than this moment. If you fail
to catch it in this present moment, you will
not get it, however many times you are
reborn in hundreds of thousands of years.

——Zen Master Seppo
