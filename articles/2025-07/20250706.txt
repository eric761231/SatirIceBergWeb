與其汲取知識,不如淨化思維,如果思維完全清澈,那麼真理已屬於你…這
稱為虛無、全能的目己或全知。當你無所不知時,就像是黑暗的天空。有時
閃電劃過天際,過目即逝,之後完全忘記它,什麼都沒有留下,只剩黑暗;
而當閃電產生亮光,美麗的景象呈現眼前。富我們達到虛無的境界,已經預
備好隨時迎接閃電。

——Shunryu Suzuki Roshi
  鈴木俊隆

Instead of gathering knowledge, you should seek to clear your mind.
If your mind is clear, true knowledge is already yours.... This is called
emptiness, or omnipotent self, or knowing everything. When you
know everything, you are like a dark sky. Sometimes a flashing will
come through the dark sky. After it passes, you forget all about it, and
there is nothing left but the dark sky....And when the lightning does
flash, a wonderful sight may be seen. When we have emptiness we
are always prepared for watching the flashing.

——Shunryu Suzuki Roshi
