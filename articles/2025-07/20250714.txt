知人者智,自知者明。
勝人者有力,自勝者強。
知足者富。強行者有志。
不失其所者久。死而不亡者壽。

——老子,道德經第三十三章

Knowing others is wisdom;
Knowing the self is enlightenment.
Mastering others requires force;
Mastering the self requires strength.
He who knows he has enough is rich.
Perseverance is a sign of will power.
He who stays where he is endures.
To die but not to perish is to be eternally present.

——Lao Tzu
  Tao Te Ching, Chapter 33
