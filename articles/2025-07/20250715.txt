Tuesday                                                  Week Twelve

在這一刻,萬事無所成,無所失,
沒有生與死,只有全然的靜默,
此刻是無限的,其中蘊藏著無窮的歡欣。

——Hui-neng, Sixth Patriarch of Zen
  禪宗六祖 慧能

In this moment there is nothing which comes to be. In this
moment there is nothing which ceases to be. Thus there is no
birth-and-death to be brought to an end. And so, absolute
tranquility is this present moment. Though it is at this moment,
there is no limit to this moment, and herein is eternal delight.

——Hui-neng, Sixth Patriarch of Zen
