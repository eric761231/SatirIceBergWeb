星期六                                                     第十二週
Saturday                                                  Week Twelve

你可以將自己丟進這片土地裏,
盡情地在大地之母的懷裏伸展, 
確信著,你與她,她與你為一體, 
你就像她一樣地堅定,事實上是比她千倍堅定不移。 
確信她會帶給你新生,以迎向各種新的奮鬥和苦痛, 
一如你確定她它明天就會吞沒你。 
不是某天,而是現在、今天, 每一天它都帶給你新生,
不只一次,而是千萬次, 就像每一天,它都吞沒你千萬次。 
永恆地,永遠地"現在"只有一個,唯一,同樣的"現在", 
當下是唯一沒有終點的東西。

——Erwin Schroedinger
  量子力學發明人

...you can throw yourself flat on the ground, 
stretched out upon Mother Earth, 
with the certain conviction that you are one with her and she with you. 
You are as firmly established, as invulnerable as she, 
indeed a thousand times firmer and more invulnerable. 
As surely as she will engulf you tomorrow, 
so surely she will bring you forth anew to new striving and suffering. 
And not merely 'some day': now, today, every day she is bringing you forth, 
not once but thousands of times, just as every day she engulfs you a thousand times over. 
For eternally and always there is only one now, one and the same now; 
the present is the only thing that has no end.

——Erwin Schroedinger
  Inventor of quantum mechanics
